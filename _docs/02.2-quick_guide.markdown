<div class="snippet">
  <pre><code>
    client
      Contains your client side code and our favs, React, Redux + Stylus.
      |_components
        This is the folder for your React components. We love React and how it helps us to manage User Interface complexity. Read more in the Explore section.

      |_styles
        This is the folder for your CSS files, in this case .styl files. We like Stylus, a CSS preprocessor that tackles big scale style issues.

      app.jsx
        The entry point for the client. It contains powerful Electrode modules that we will leverage as we continue to Build More.

      routes.jsx
        The shared routes between client and server are defined here in one place and we use react-router.

    config
        Your environment specific configuration code goes here. We have used a versatile module here, our Electrode-Confippet, a preset config that you can customize and extend.

    node_modules
      Other Javascript files contained in modules that we will use in this application, including Electrode modules that create your out-the-box Univeresal app.

    server
      Contains your server code. Electrode-Server gives you a powerful plugin capable of SSR out the box. Learn more in the Explore section.

    .babelrc
      Where we extend our app babel configuration to allow us to use the presets and any additional babel settings.

    .editorconfig
    .gitattributes
    .gitignore

      A webpack loader, plugin and library to make NodeJS 'require' understand complex files like images when we are doing server side rendering.

    .travis.yml
      A file where you can customize any process in the Travis default build environment.

    gulpfile.js
      A file that stores all your Gulp configurations. We will explore this more in Getting Started: Intermediate.
