Let's test out the published YourAwesomeComponent module! Use your editor to open Your-Awesome-App and follow the steps below:

```bash
  npm i your-awesome-npm-module --save
```

Navigate to `<your-awesome-app>/client/components/home.jsx` Copy, paste and save the code below. Remember to swap out `ResourceList` and `resource-list` for the name of your actual component (`<your-awesome-component`):

```javascript
  'use strict';

  //code for home.jsx file
  import React from "react";

  import {ResourceList} from "resource-list";

  const exaList = [
    {name: "electrode", img: "//goo.gl/CZ4wAF", size: 12},
    {name: "hapi", img: "//goo.gl/q9uIFW", size: 12},
    {name: "React", img: "//goo.gl/dL5MXT", size: 12},
    {name: "Redux", img: "//goo.gl/L0mLmT", size: 12},
    {name: "Webpack", img: "//goo.gl/2AV3Dn", size: 12},
    {img: "//goo.gl/UdhbKO", name: "wizard", size: 12}
  ];

  export class Home extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
        <h1>Hello <a href="https://github.com/electrode-io">Electrode</a></h1>
          <ResourceList ourFriends={exaList}/>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }

```

```bash
  gulp dev
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser and marvel at your Awesome Tech Party App!
Let's continue to build more by creating a [Hapi server plugin](build_server_plugin.html).
