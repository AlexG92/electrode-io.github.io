###Get Hapi + Build a server plugin

At WalmartLabs, we use Hapi because of it's flexible and robust plugin system. It allows us to modularize our application into isolated pieces of business logic and reusable utilities.

Let's make a deal! Actually, scratch that, let's make a plugin! Plugins are way to extend our server's functionality. Building upon our open source theme, let's make a plugin that retrieves the Github contributors of our "party friends."

We are going to use the [GitHub Api] (https://developer.github.com/v3/) to grab the latest 10 contributors of our Open Source friends and display them in Your Awesome App.

The GitHub [site] (https://developer.github.com/v3/) has great documentation and awesome libraries to help jumpstart our plugin. Let's begin there by installing a Node.js wrapper called [Node-github] (https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github):

```bash
npm install github
```

At their core, plugins are a simple `register` object, that has the signature `function(server, options, next)`. Read more about building plugins from scratch in the [Hapi documentation] (http://hapijs.com/tutorials/plugins). For now, navigate to the <your-awesome-app>/server/plugins folder. Make a folder called `GitHub`. Cd into your new `GitHub` folder and:

```bash
touch github.js && index.js
```

Navigate to github.js. This is where we will make an external API call to Github and request the last ten contributors of our selected Open Source 'friend' using a URL `https://api.github.com/ + /repos/:user/:repo/contributors`. Because we are looking at public repos we do not have to go through the process of oAuth to access GitHub data. Our GitHub wrapper [library](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github) will allow us a built in method, `github.repos.getContributors({})` to streamline this process and return an array of Open Source contributors.
