  Electrode: Universal React and Node Applications simplified, performant, and reusable.
</p>

<h5 class="p-header">
  Our three main pillars:
</h5>

<p class="overview-header">Core: Quick + Easy</p>
<p class="overview-text">The heart of the platform is Electrode “archetypes”. It allows scaffolding of the app, react components, and ensures that app, components, and modules are simple to develop, consistent, and easy to deploy. It only takes five minutes, with our <a href="#" class="doc-link">Getting Started: Quick Guide</a>.</p>

<p class="overview-header">Stand Alone Modules: Optimize Where You Want</p>
<p class="overview-text">As part of the Electrode Platform, we have a ton of modules that each do one specific task. Anything from Server Side Render caching to flexible configuration management.These modules can be used independently of the platform, so feel free to grab them for your existing apps <a href="#" class="doc-link">here</a>.</p>

<p class="overview-header">Tools: Power Up Your Existing Applications</p>
<p class="overview-text">The Electrode Platform also has tools that can be consumed by existing applications, but using the Electrode core would allow for instant integration. There are currently two powerful tools: one around <a href="#" class="doc-link">discovery of reusable components</a> and the other around <a href="#" class="doc-link">performance of JS bundles</a>.</p>
